** Jump to CUSTOM_ID
   One of the properties that is standard in orgmode nomenclature
   is that of CUSTOM_ID. This property appears in your property
   drawer. It should be unique across your entire set of org files.
   The OrgDb has access to all your custom ids across all the parsed
   files. This provides a really quick way for you to jump back to
   what is effectively a bookmark.

   OrgJumpToCustomId will pop up a quick selection window
   and you can jump to the customID you have set.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   * My Heading
     :PROPERTIES:
     CUSTOM_ID: @johnsmith
     :END:
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   In this example you can jump to My Heading really quickly by fuzzy finding
   the name @johnsmith.
   You can also use orgs internal link system to jump to this ID within the file.
