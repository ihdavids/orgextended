** Formatting
   Org supports a bunch of formatting options.
   Where possible they have chosen formatting options
   that have the flavour of the format you are choosing.

   - *Bold*
   - _Underline_
   - /Italics/
   - +Strikethrough+
   - ~Code~
   - =Verbatim=

   These are most useful when writing org files for [[file:pandoc.org][Export]] 

** Tags
   *OrgInsertTag* tries to help with the rapid insertion of tags.
   The tooltip / suggestions are currently somewhat broken. I hope to improve this in the future.

   Inserting a second tag will append the new tag. The system also has pseudo intellisense.
   We are using the input panel instead of the quick select panel because you need to be able to insert
   items not in the list.

** Todo Cycling
   Because changing the status of your task is something that you do
   quite often when using org as a means of organizing a project,
   org supports the means of quickly switching between task states.

   - OrgChangeTodo - Will let you quickly change the state of
     a task. I don't support cycling at the moment, only picking from
     a quick list.

** Scheduling
   Inserting dates and times is one of many things we do often in org.
   I have started working on a date picker that can help /somewhat/ with
   scheduling efforts.

   [[file:scheduling.gif]] 

   The date picker is not perfect but I hope to improve it over time.
   The date picker CAN use the mouse to select a date.

   The keybindings are a little odd. The greater than and less than
   signs will move you by date. Holding down alt and ctrl allows you to
   move faster with the same keys. 

   To get mouse support you have to use a somewhat controversial feature of sublime. The sublime mousemap does not have the same context support 
   as keybindings.
   I have not included the mousemap in the package, but there is a means
   of generating one automatically.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Preferences > Package Settings > Org Extended > Setup MouseMap
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   This generates the mousemap in your User folder. Alt + Click should select the date for you.

** Check Boxes [1/3]

   Our org implementation has some basic support for checked lists.
   These are a weaker version of a heading.

   - [ ] Something that needs to be done.
   - [x] Something that is already done.
   - [-] Something partially done. [1/2]
     - [ ] Something to be done
     - [x] Done

   - *OrgRecalcAllCheckbox* - recalculate all checkboxes in view
   - *OrgCheckboxToggle*    - Toggle the checkbox and recalc
   - *OrgRecalcCheckbox*    - Recalc [/] boxes below this.

   In addition, *OrgToggle* is aware of checkboxes and will toggle the checkbox

** Priority Editing
   Org has extensive priority support, we do not!
   While you can mark up your file with any priority tags you would like.

   [[file:priorities.jpg]] 

   1. Color coding of priorities is limited to the A B C priorities.
   2. The PRIORITIES comment does not impact the quick insertion.
   3. You can cycle priorities using a command but it is currently restricted to the built in priorities.
