** htmlDefaultSkipSrc Not Respected
	BugFix htmlDefaultSkipSrc was not being respected
	when exporting to html. Thanks to bradleysmith who found that ditaa source
	blocks were exporting both the image and the source to
	html files even when ditaa was listed as a source skip block

	The plist system by its nature overrides this list if explicitly stated. 
	Internally we did not have a way of determining if a user had explicitly 
	set an exports mode or if we were operating in the default
	state. The system now has a default setting allowing this to work again.
