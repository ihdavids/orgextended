* 2.0.0
  2.0 is about adding support for the orgs server.
  The goal is bring my VSCode and sublime plugins into
  alignment but mostly:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The orgs server is an attempt to move the org mode capabilities that are beyond just
  editing an org file into a flexible shareable core that can be used here and outside 
  of sublime to really help the org community to make the most of their org data everywhere.

  One of org modes most useful feature is the ability to combine the various sources of input we
  have: slack, email(mu4e), jira, your notes, ledger, todo lists, presentations, quick captures etc
  into one searchable, taggable, exportable place that is easy to extend. In this, org mode is something special. 

  I feel org mode's next trick in our modern fragmented digital world is to break free of an editor only tech (emacs) 
  and really live everywhere you work. At the command line, on the web, on your phone AND in your editor.
  #+END_QUOTE

  A lot of the current existing orgs functionality is already implemented in this existing sublime text plugin. 
  This is however, just a repeat of emacs. Locking all of this mess into one way of working with it. 
  Orgs is looking to really break that paradigm.

  Free and open yes, but also extensible and everywhere.

  NOTE: We now depend on requests which added idna and urllib3
        so please restart Sublime Text a few times when upgrading
        to ensure dependencies are properly installed.
