* 1.2.55
  1.2.54 was a maintenance release with the goal of sorting some of the more 
  painful reported issues people were struggling with.

  This release is about trying to clear the Issue list of any requested features.
  This is all in preparation for my next big personal feature push.

  I have been sort of forced to work in VSCode for the last few years and as such I have
  built a similar plugin to this one for VSCode (although I have not officially released it)

  That plugin took a slightly different route. As I was faced with the daunting task of 
  duplicating what I had done here, I realized I had been foolish. LSP is a model I should have
  taken a page from, right from the get go. 

  So While there are a ton of highlighting, editing 
  and general movement commands built into the VSCode plugin the database and many of
  the auto formatting, refiling, capturing etc is done in a sort of org mode server over a rest
  api. It has always bugged me that this plugin is limited by the editor integration and
  while this brings org outside of emacs, its still locked into yet another editor.

  My plan is to migrate to some of the ideas I had with the VSCode version wrapping the existing
  DB in an abstraction so it can consume and work with the orgs server.
  I hope to offer a choice, either use the built in python DB
  in this plugin, OR choose to run the orgs server (it's written in Go) externally and get
  a web portal into your org files and command line capture and other CLI goodness as well
  as the editor integration. This will be a 2.0 offering of this plugin.

  orgs has other really great features. It has a JIRA integration that allows the creation of JIRA
  tickets from org files and syncing JIRA to an org file. It has a nice auto git sync option
  and some new exporters like a latex exporter that supports the DnD2Latex project, impressjs 
  AND reveal exporter and an extensible, universal todo query language instead of the hacky thing
  I built into the Agenda system in this plugin.

  My end game here is that I would like to provide an LSP like setup for org-mode that 
  can be used from any editor, but takes org outside of my editor in a variety of ways.
  This will have the benefit that:

  - Org is in your editor and can be ported to others without re-inventing the wheel.
  - Using Orgs allows for an HTML portal rendering your org files directly to your browser or phone
    helping with the challenge of using org on mobile.
  - Support the org-protocol capture mechanism
  - Access, refile, tag and search your orgs from your command line.
  - Supports integration into other tools like JIRA, Trello, Confluence, Todoist, Ad nauseum.
  - Supports a framework for exporting from org to other formats and importing from other formats to org.
  - Provides really powerful and comprehensive search tools for your data.
  - Is extensible enough I can integrate with beancount or other great text based finance tools with literate programming style
    reports, combined with the exporters offering all the invoicing, and other integrations I really appreciate.
  - Takes the dynamic burden of execution and refiling et al off the editor itself and pushes it squarely on a capable backend.
    In the past, chasing after updates in how the editor handles reloading of files has been a serious issue.
  - Is flexible enough, but also lightweight enough that you can use it in a ton of different creative ways.

  Anyways, BEFORE I get to working on the orgs integration, I really wanted to spend some time to cleanup anything that 
  has been frustrating those people that have been on this journey with me and have been trying to use this thing.
  I sincerely hope you get value out of it.

** OrgCapture New File added TAGS instead of FILETAGS
   - OrgCapture when it creates a new file was adding TAGS: refile vs FILETAGS: :refile:

** Org Archive All Done Command
	Stuk asked for a command to archive all todos with a DONE status.
	This first version of the command is simplistic and hardcoded to DONE status but it will	
	iterate through a buffer and archive all the DONE TODOS.
