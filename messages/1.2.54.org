* 1.2.54
** 3.8 Upgrade
   Package upgraded to the 3.8 runtime.
   TextTable plugin is still running on 3.3 but orgextended itself
   is now running on 3.8 for greater performance and cleanliness.

   NOTE: YOU WILL NEED TO RESTART SUBLIME TEXT SEVERAL TIMES TO ALLOW 
         DEPENDENCIES TO INSTALL AND UPGRADE.

   I have run into some problems where the dateutil.rrule package will not update from the 3.3 version
   to the 3.8 version.
   
   The only solution I have found is to reinstall sublime and then reinstall OrgExtended.
   This forces the upgrade and allows things to work again.

** Agenda haschildtask filter 
   Thanks to tim3z for his contribution to the agenda:

   - I sometimes need to filter for tasks with/without child tasks

   This adds the following keywords for child tasks

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     haschildtasks
     nochildtasks
   #+END_QUOTE
   
** Extended default binary formats for links
   Thanks to dyaso for extending the default binary formats list
   to include pdfs and word documents.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     "file_exclude_patterns": [
        "*.pdf",
        "*.doc",
        "*.docx",
        "*.docm",
    ],
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** FIX Agenda Day View Rendering Bug  
	Fix for: [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/85][Agenda does not work in ST4]]	

	In recent builds of sublime text 4 The composite Agenda class was only able to render the first view
	when the tab is first opened. I am not sure why. I added a recursive command that draws on a second pass
	to work around the issue. This is not ideal but it at least gets things rendering again.

** FIX Todo View Not Rendering in ST4
   Fix for: [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/80][Org Todo View command shows an empty file, despite TODOs existing in tracked files]] 
   This seems to have been the same issue as the Day View Rendering bug.
   When the tab pops up the first write attempt to the buffer seems to not be accepted until control 
   has been returned to ST. I have made the command recursive to fix the issue.

   - The same problem also existed with Org Agenda Custom View which is consumed by Org Choose Custom View

   Overall these are all the same issue and something that has developed in modern versions of Sublime Text. I am not sure 
   what has caused this but I suspect some of the read only features I am using are perhaps asynchronous events in some fashion and
   I may be racing with some internal message pump I do not fully understand vs my plugin thread.

** FIX Agenda Week View Lineup With Week
   Some previous changes to the week view had it a week off from the current day.
   This has been fixed

** FIX Color Scheme Genereator
   Fix for: [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/83][Generated color schemas (partially) use camelCase instead of snake_case]]

   If you follow the [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended_docs/blob/master/setup.org#color-scheme-generator][Color Scheme Generator]] instructions the generator seems to sometimes generate a:
   lineHighlight global vs line_highlight. This is an odd quirk that seems to manifest itself when parsing some
   existing color schemes. That camelCase version comes FROM the parsed version of the color scheme and I am not sure why.
   We now account for this and export a line_highlight variant that matches the lineHighlight version in the globals.

** FIX Agenda View Overlap Sorting
   Fix for: [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/86][Overlapping events can appear out of order in the Agenda timeline]] 

   Thanks to r4dian for reporting. 

   This particular issue only seemed to happen if you moved to a previous day in the agenda. The time list was not being sorted properly
   resulting in times appearing out of order during the day.
   
** List Sort Docs
   There was confusion over the simplistic Org Sort List command.
   I added some quick docs to help demonstrate how that command works. It currently does not work on headings. 
   Contributions welcome. 

   [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended_docs/blob/master/lists.org#sorting-lists][Org Sort List]] 

** List Cookie Issues
   [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/84][Cookies are wrongly calculated in lists with checkboxes]]


   List cookies:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      - List [1/2]     
         - [x] A
         - [ ] B
      - List2
         - [ ] This should NOT be included in list 1
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   had a problem when list types alternated from unordered lists to checked lists.
   This is not perfect but has been improved and should now no longer be combined.
