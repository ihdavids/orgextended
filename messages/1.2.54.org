* 1.2.54
** 3.8 Upgrade
   Package upgraded to the 3.8 runtime.
   TextTable plugin is still running on 3.3 but orgextended itself
   is now running on 3.8 for greater performance and cleanliness.

   NOTE: YOU WILL NEED TO RESTART SUBLIME TEXT SEVERAL TIMES TO ALLOW 
         DEPENDENCIES TO INSTALL AND UPGRADE.

   I have run into some problems where the dateutil.rrule package will not update from the 3.3 version
   to the 3.8 version.
   
   The only solution I have found is to reinstall sublime and then reinstall OrgExtended.
   This forces the upgrade and allows things to work again.

** Agenda haschildtask filter 
   Thanks to tim3z for his contribution to the agenda:

   - I sometimes need to filter for tasks with/without child tasks

   This adds the following keywords for child tasks

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     haschildtasks
     nochildtasks
   #+END_QUOTE
   
** Extended default binary formats for links
   Thanks to dyaso for extending the default binary formats list
   to include pdfs and word documents.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     "file_exclude_patterns": [
        "*.pdf",
        "*.doc",
        "*.docx",
        "*.docm",
    ],
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** FIX Agenda Day View Rendering Bug  
	Fix for: [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/85][Agenda does not work in ST4]]	

	In recent builds of sublime text 4 The composite Agenda class was only able to render the first view
	when the tab is first opened. I am not sure why. I added a recursive command that draws on a second pass
	to work around the issue. This is not ideal but it at least gets things rendering again.

** FIX Agenda Week View Lineup With Week
   Some previous changes to the week view had it a week off from the current day.
   This has been fixed

** FIX Color Scheme Genereator
   Fix for: [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/83][Generated color schemas (partially) use camelCase instead of snake_case]]

   If you follow the [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended_docs/blob/master/setup.org#color-scheme-generator][Color Scheme Generator]] instructions the generator seems to sometimes generate a:
   lineHighlight global vs line_highlight. This is an odd quirk that seems to manifest itself when parsing some
   existing color schemes. That camelCase version comes FROM the parsed version of the color scheme and I am not sure why.
   We now account for this and export a line_highlight variant that matches the lineHighlight version in the globals.

   
** List Sort Docs
   There was confusion over the simplistic Org Sort List command.
   I added some quick docs to help demonstrate how that command works. It currently does not work on headings. 
   Contributions welcome.
